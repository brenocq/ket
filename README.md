**Ket** (|⟩) is a quantum computing library for C++, with first-class Python
bindings. You describe a quantum circuit, add gates to it, simulate it on a
built-in state-vector simulator, and sample measurement outcomes.

Ket represents a circuit as a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of gates: each
node is a gate, and edges connect gates that share a qubit, capturing the
order in which they must execute. This makes gate dependencies explicit and
leaves room for future analysis and optimization passes.

## Status

This is an early, intentionally small implementation. It can build circuits
out of a handful of basic gates and simulate them exactly.

### Available gates

| Method                      | Gate                | Qubits |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| `c.h(q)`                    | Hadamard            | 1      |
| `c.x(q)`                    | Pauli-X (NOT)       | 1      |
| `c.z(q)`                    | Pauli-Z             | 1      |
| `c.cnot(control, target)`   | Controlled-NOT      | 2      |


## How the simulation works

Ket uses a **full state-vector simulator**. A register of *n* qubits is
represented by a vector of `2ⁿ` complex amplitudes, initialized to the
ground state |0…0⟩.

Each gate is applied as an in-place linear transformation over the state
vector:

- **Single-qubit gates** (H, X, Z) apply a 2×2 unitary to every pair of
  amplitudes that differ only in the target qubit's bit.
- **CNOT** swaps the amplitudes of the basis states whose control bit is set,
  toggling the target bit.

Qubit `i` corresponds to bit `i` of the basis-state index (little-endian).
The simulator walks the circuit's DAG in topological order — which, by
construction, matches insertion order — and applies each gate in turn.

**Measurement** samples a basis state according to the Born rule: outcome `i`
occurs with probability `|amplitudeᵢ|²`. Sampling uses the inverse-CDF method
with a uniform random draw. You can pass your own `std::mt19937` for
reproducible results, or omit it to use a per-thread random seed.

## Example

```cpp
#include <ket/ket.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Build a Bell state: H on q0, then CNOT(q0 -> q1).
  ket::Circuit c{2};
  c.h(0);
  c.cnot(0, 1);

  std::cout << c.print();

  // Simulate and inspect the amplitudes.
  ket::StateVector state = ket::run(c);
  std::cout << state.print();

  // Sample 1000 measurement outcomes.
  std::mt19937 rng{42};
  int counts[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  for (int shot = 0; shot < 1000; ++shot) {
    ++counts[ket::measure(state, rng)];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    std::cout << "|" << i << ">: " << counts[i] << '\n';
  }
}
```

### Circuit print output

`c.print()` renders the circuit as a Qiskit-style ASCII diagram:

```
     ┌───┐
q_0: ┤ H ├──■──
     └───┘┌─┴─┐
q_1: ─────┤ X ├
          └───┘
```

### Simulation output

The Bell circuit produces the entangled state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2:

```
|00⟩: 0.707107
|01⟩: 0
|10⟩: 0
|11⟩: 0.707107
```

Sampling collapses onto the two correlated outcomes in roughly equal
proportions, and never onto |01⟩ or |10⟩:

```
|0>: 493
|1>: 0
|2>: 0
|3>: 507
```

## Python

Ket ships Python bindings built with [pybind11]. The Python API mirrors the C++
one — `Circuit`, `run`, and `measure` — with a few Pythonic touches:
`Circuit` and `StateVector` render through `print()`/`str()`, `StateVector`
supports `len()` and indexing (returning a Python `complex`), and `measure`
takes an optional `seed` instead of an RNG object.

### Install

The bindings compile from source via [scikit-build-core], so a C++20 compiler
and CMake are required. Install into a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

For development, an editable install recompiles on the next import after a
C++ change:

```sh
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

### Example

```python
import ket
from collections import Counter

# Build a Bell state: H on q0, then CNOT(q0 -> q1).
c = ket.Circuit(2)
c.h(0)
c.cnot(0, 1)
print(c)

# Simulate and inspect the amplitudes.
state = ket.run(c)
print(state)

# Sample measurement outcomes (pass `seed` for reproducibility).
counts = Counter(ket.measure(state, seed=s) for s in range(1000))
for i in range(4):
    print(f"|{i}>: {counts[i]}")
```

Output:

```
     ┌───┐
q_0: ┤ H ├──■──
     └───┘┌─┴─┐
q_1: ─────┤ X ├
          └───┘
|00⟩: 0.707107
|01⟩: 0
|10⟩: 0
|11⟩: 0.707107
|0>: 511
|1>: 0
|2>: 0
|3>: 489
```

## Building

Ket uses CMake and requires a C++20 compiler. Tests are built with GoogleTest,
which is fetched automatically.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

To use Ket in your own project, link against the `ket` library target and add
`include/` to your include path. The umbrella header `<ket/ket.hpp>` pulls in
the whole public API.

The Python bindings are normally built through `pip` (see [Python](#python)).
To build them directly with CMake instead, enable the `KET_PYTHON` option:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DKET_PYTHON=ON
cmake --build build
```

## Limitations

- **State-vector only.** Memory and time grow as `2ⁿ`, so simulation is
  practical only for a small number of qubits (~20–25).
- **Small gate set.** Only H, X, Z, and CNOT are implemented.
- **No parameterized or multi-controlled gates** (e.g. rotations, Toffoli).
- **Measurement does not collapse** the state — it samples from a fixed state
  vector, which is ideal for shot-style experiments but not for mid-circuit
  measurement with feed-forward.
- **No circuit-level measurement instruction yet** — measurement operates on a
  simulated state vector rather than being recorded in the circuit/DAG.
- **No noise modeling.**
- **No layer packing in the diagram** — each gate occupies its own column.

## Future work

- More gates: Y, S, T, controlled-Z, and parameterized rotations (Rx, Ry, Rz).
- Multi-controlled gates (Toffoli, etc.).
- A circuit-level measurement instruction, with a classical register rendered
  in the diagram.
- DAG optimization passes (gate cancellation, commutation, fusion) — and a
  scheduler that no longer relies on insertion order.
- Layer packing in the ASCII renderer.
- Alternative backends (e.g. stabilizer or tensor-network simulators).
